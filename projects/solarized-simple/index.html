popular <a href=http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>Solarized</a> color scheme.</p><p>solarized-simple was originally a pair of TextMate themes (dark and light),
but making adjustments to both, keeping theme files updated across
workstations, and switching between editors and IDEs proved to complicate
this greatly.</p><p>Now, solarized-simple is a theme generator. It currently is only capable of
generating a TextMate theme compatible with TextMate, Sublime Text 3, and
maybe other editors.</p><h2 id=rationale>Rationale</h2><p>Solarized is great. It&rsquo;s easy on the eyes, provides guidelines for coloring
any and all tokens, and can easily be used at night thanks to the dark
variation.</p><p>As with most editor color schemes, Solarized&rsquo;s TextMate theme over-uses
colors. In fact, it was hard to find scopes of text that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> given a
non-default color.</p><p><a href=/images/projects/solarized-simple.png><img src=/images/projects/solarized-simple.png alt="Picture of PHP code colored via solarized-simple" title=solarized-simple></a></p><p>I generally dislike my text editor looking like confetti, and find that
scanning a document that utilizes only a few colors is much easier in the
long term. Thus, solarized-simple was born.</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/jadefish/solarized-simple>solarized-simple on Github</a></p></main><footer class="bg-dark fg-light"><div class=row><span>&copy; 2022 Nick Miller</span></div></footer></body></html>
