renaming files in a specified directory according to an array of customizable
options.</p><p><a href=/images/projects/FileRenamer.png><img src=/images/projects/FileRenamer.png alt="Picture of FileRenamer" title=FileRenamer></a></p><p>FileRenamer is written in C# utilizing
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms>WinForms</a>. It was written on
Windows 8, but seems to work fine on anything supporting with .NET 4.5.</p><h2 id=rationale>Rationale</h2><p>FileRenamer was written out of necessity - I had a need to rename a large
number of files in a few different directories according to each file&rsquo;s
metadata.</p><p>At the time, I was not very familiar with PowerShell (and
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>WSL</a> didn&rsquo;t exist), so
I solved the problem with the tools and knowledge available to me.</p><h2 id=links>Links</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/jadefish/filerenamer>FileRenamer on Github</a></p></main><footer class="bg-dark fg-light"><div class=row><span>&copy; 2022 Nick Miller</span></div></footer></body></html>
