## About
You've reached the personal website of Nick Miller. I'm a software engineer
currently writing Ruby at [Evvnt](http://www.evvnt.com).

For the past 15 years, I've been constantly writing code and have loved every
minute of it. I'm self-starting, motivated, and always looking to improve
myself and my code.

I make a point to learn something new every day, and constantly challenge
myself to step outside my comfort zone and solve difficult problems.

I enjoy long walks with large data sets, have a love affair with web
development, and never manage to go an entire day without writing or
tearing apart _something_.
