# Project: nmiller.info

**nmiller.info** is my personal website. It's statically generated and is built via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The site is hosted on GitHub pages and is automatically deployed whenever a new commit is pushed to `main`.

Internally, the site simply interpolates markdown files with a base HTML Go template.
