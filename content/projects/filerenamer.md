# Project: FileRenamer

## Overview
**FileRenamer** is a small utility for Windows which provides a GUI for
renaming files in a specified directory according to an array of customizable
options.

FileRenamer is written in C# utilizing
[WinForms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms). It was written on
Windows 8, but seems to work fine on anything supporting with .NET 4.5.

## Rationale
FileRenamer was written out of necessity - I had a need to rename a large
number of files in a few different directories according to each file's
metadata.

At the time, I was not very familiar with PowerShell (and
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) didn't exist), so
I solved the problem with the tools and knowledge available to me.
