# Project: solarized-simple

## Overview
**solarized-simple** is a "reduced-color" text editor theme based on the
popular [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme.

solarized-simple was originally a pair of TextMate themes (dark and light),
but making adjustments to both, keeping theme files updated across
workstations, and switching between editors and IDEs proved to complicate
this greatly.

Now, solarized-simple is a theme generator. It currently is only capable of
generating a TextMate theme compatible with TextMate, Sublime Text 3, and
maybe other editors.

## Rationale
Solarized is great. It's easy on the eyes, provides guidelines for coloring
any and all tokens, and can easily be used at night thanks to the dark
variation.

As with most editor color schemes, Solarized's TextMate theme over-uses
colors. In fact, it was hard to find scopes of text that _weren't_ given a
non-default color.

I generally dislike my text editor looking like confetti, and find that
scanning a document that utilizes only a few colors is much easier in the
long term. Thus, solarized-simple was born.
