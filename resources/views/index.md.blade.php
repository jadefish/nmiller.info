# Home
You've reached the personal website of Nick Miller. I'm a back end developer
currently working at [MacUpdate.com](https://www.macupdate.com).

For the past 15 years, I've been constantly writing code and have loved every
minute of it. I'm self-starting, motivated, and always looking to improve
myself and my code.

I make a point to learn something new every day, and constantly challenge
myself to step outside my comfort zone and solve difficult problems.

I enjoy long walks with large data sets, have a love affair with web
development, and never manage to go an entire day without writing or
tearing apart _something_.

## Projects
Most of my projects are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jadefish),
including the source for this website.

## Résumé
My résumé is written in LaTeX. An up-to-date prepared PDF version is always
available [here](#), and the source is available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jadefish/resume).
